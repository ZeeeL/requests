 Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
 beings.
 .
 Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
 verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of
 the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.
 It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to
 perform the simplest of tasks.
 .
 Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.
